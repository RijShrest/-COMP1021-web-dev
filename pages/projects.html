        <h3>1) Conducted <strong>Extended Essay/Research Paper</strong> in the topic "Efficiency of inverted index for
            faster keyword search on a large volume of unstructured data." (Linux, Java, Lucene, Meili Search)</h3>

        <ul class="sub-projects-indent">
            <li>Compared two open source inverted indexing softwares. (Lucene and Meile Search)</li>
            <li>Wrote and modified code using Java to optimize and make these technologies to work.</li>
            <li>Tested the technologies in different sized data sets by creating its own indexes.</li>
            <li>Concluded Meile Search took longer to index and the time was increasing non linearly AND Lucene was
                faster for searching.</li>
        </ul>
