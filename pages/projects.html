            <h1>1) Conducted <strong>Extended Essay/Research Paper</strong> in the topic "Efficiency of inverted index for faster keyword search on a large volume of unstructured data." (Linux, Java, Lucene, Meili Search)</h1>

            <ul class="sub-projects-indent">
                <li>Compared two open source inverted indexing softwares. (Lucene and Meile Search)</li>
                <li>Wrote and modified code using Java to optimize and make these technologies to work.</li>
                <li>Tested the technologies in different sized data sets by creating its own indexes.</li>
                <li>Concluded Meile Search took longer to index and the time was increasing non linearly AND Lucene was faster for searching.</li>
